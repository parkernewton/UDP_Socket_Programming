This project was completed as COEN 146 Computer Networks Lab no. 2. The goal was to transfer a text file from a client host to a remote server host via a UDP network communication link. Socket programming procedures and linux C API's were implemented to establish a socket on the client- and server-side, bind the server's socket to its native IP Address and Server Port, and send and receive both the name and the contents of the text file. In order to run these programs, download client.c and test.txt to the same directory, and server.c to another. Run server.c on command line in the background followed by running client.c, and the test.txt file will be sent to and received by the server, writing to a new text file in the directory of server.c.
